## How to Play
In each round of the game the participants are (virtually) in a different place, for example: in a polar research station.  
However, one of the people is not the place, but "spy". This person does not know in which place the group is; all the others, of course, do not know, 
who is spy.
A countdown of 8 minutes is started. The question round then begins. One player starts and asks any other player a question, for example:
```bash
Do you like being here?
```
The questioned player now answers with any answer:
```bash
I like it here, but I'm cold.
```
Both the question and the answer should, of course, be formulated in such a way that the questioned player proves to the questioner that he knows 
where the group is at the moment. 
Since the players in the example are on a polar station, the statement that it is cold is certainly a satisfactory indication for the questioner, 
that the interviewee is aware of the game situation. At the same time, the questions and answers should give the spy as little information as possible. 
In the example, the statement that it is cold would already be a huge clue to the plot location. The spy could learn relatively quickly in this way, 
where the group is located.
The questioned player may then question the next player. He may choose any person for this, but not the person who just asked him.
In the example, the statement that it is cold would already be a huge clue to the plot location. The spy could learn relatively quickly in this way, 
Of course, answering and then asking a question is especially difficult for the spy. The spy does not know where the group is. 
He has to choose an answer that is as satisfactory as possible without saying too much about the content. Of course, he can build on the answers of the players 
and use their assumptions about the possible whereabouts of the group. Likewise, he must then ask a question that does not immediately reveal 
that he does not know where he is.

### Spy vote
If a teammate has a suspicion who the spy could be, he calls "Stop". This can happen at any point in the game, 
except when such a vote is already in progress. The player now announces his suspicion. This is followed immediately - without long discussion - by a vote 
a vote of all participants whether they agree with the accusation and the accused player is really the spy. 
If the result is unanimous (the accused is of course excluded), the round is over. If the accused is really the spy, 
the non-spies win, otherwise the (real) spy wins. If there is no unanimous result, the game continues as normal.
Each player may accuse someone else only once per game round (per "location").

### Spy reveals
Likewise, the spy can call "Stop" at any time. He then announces that he is the spy and guesses where the group is. 
If his guess is correct, he (the spy) wins, but if it is wrong, then the rest of the group wins.

### Time lapse
In any case, the round ends after the countdown of 8 minutes. It then immediately moves to a vote. 
All players simultaneously point to the player they suspect is the spy (the spy himself also points to a player, of course). 
The player with the simple majority is considered the accused; if there is a tie, there is still a deciding vote between the players with the most votes. 
If the accused player is the spy, the rest of the group wins; if it is not the spy, the spy wins.
